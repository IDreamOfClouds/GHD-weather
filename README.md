# Code explanations

1. Weather.py was Python code to grab weather sonde data from the net and then interpret it so it was easy to understand. (2016).

2. metric_calculator_new.m was MATLAB code to calculate how vulnerable a location was to poor odour. (2016).

3. Script1_filtered_checklags_final_singlelag_CORRECT.m was MATLAB code to analyse how well a hydrological model was performing in relation to producing runoff values that matched observations. (2016).

4. Contour map.py was Python code to read NetCDF scalar data (e.g. temp.) and visualise it as a contour map. (2018).

5. Wind barb.py was Python code to read NetCDF vector data (e.g wind) and visualise it barbs. (2018).

6. frost_counter.py was Python code that analysed ERA-INTERIM data. It counted the number of frost periods across a multi-decadal period based on various thresholds. (2019).
